          MY LOVE
        </p>

        <p>I just forgot to say things
         in front of you!</p>

        <p>
          I can't imagine I will love someone this 
          much so that I would always think of
           losing you babe.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the moment we met, maybe before that only
        I didnt know what magic you had done for me!
        </p>

        <p>
           You have a heart of gold, and it's
          evident in the way that I already won u.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes of course I feel jealous of sort of things u
           would say maybe i won't showcase that but 
           remember u need to pamper nxt second.  
        </p>

        <p class="center"></p>

        <p>
          Please take care of your time to consider my moodswings,
          jealous,sadness,excitments,taunts and especially yellings
          it's not a request it's a compulsory chore darling.
        </p>

        <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>

        <p class="center">Tum janti ho mere liye kya important hai</p>

        <p>apka pyara</p>
